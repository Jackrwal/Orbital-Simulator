# Orbital-Simulator
This Repository contains the sauce code for my Orbital Simulator Coursework project.

Welcome to the Source Code for my A-Level Computer Science 2019 Project. This is the first project i made using source control and so was learning to use Git at the time, excuse how much of a mess the repo is.

The purpose of this program is to display a number of objects in space on the screen, like stars, plannets and moon, and 
demonstrate how they move around each other by showing the objects orbiting and allowing users to build their own systems while providing
the functionality for users too;
  - Drag and drop various templated plannets into the system
  - Change the position, size, mass and density of planets
  - Save and Load their previous systems
  - Load pre-templated systems
  - See and change the equations controlling the system.
